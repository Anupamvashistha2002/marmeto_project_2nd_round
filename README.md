Look for the main HTML file. This is often named index.html or main.html.
Double-click the index.html (or equivalent) file to open it in your default web browser.

You can also use the "Open File" option in the browser’s menu (often found under File > Open File).

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory.

Run the following command:

For Python 3.x:

bash
Copy code
python -m http.server 8000
For Python 2.x:

bash
Copy code
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000.

Using Node.js (http-server):
Install Node.js from nodejs.org.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Install the http-server package globally:
bash
Copy code
npm install -g http-server
Navigate to your project directory.
Run the following command:
bash
